<p>
  <strong>Plato (/ˈpleɪtoʊ/; PLAY-toe[2] Greek: Πλάτων Plátōn, pronounced [plá.tɔːn] <br>
    PLOT-own in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC)</strong> was an Athenian philosopher <br>
    during the Classical period in Ancient Greece, founder of the Platonist school of thought, and the Academy, <br>
    the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.</p>

    <p> He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy, <br>
      along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: <br>
      "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series <br>
      of footnotes to Plato."
