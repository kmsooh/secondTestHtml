<h2>Art & Life</h2>
<h3>What is the Art?</h3> <!-- h태그는 제목이며 기본적으로 굵은글씨체와 줄바꿈이있다-->

<strong>Art is Long</strong> , <strong>Life is Short.</strong>

  <h3>ART</h3>
  <img src="ArtPict.jpg" width="50%"><br>
  Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, <br>
  auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative,<br>
  conceptual ideas, or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty<br>
  or emotional power.[1][2] In their most general form these activities include <br>
  the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, <br>
  and the aesthetic dissemination of art.

  <h3>PHILOSOPHER</h3>
  <img src="athens.jpg" width="70%"><br>
  philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into <br>
  areas that are outside either theology or science.[1] The term "philosopher" comes from <br>
  the Ancient Greek, φιλόσοφος (philosophos), meaning "lover of wisdom". The coining of <br>
  the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).[2]

  <h3>PERSON</h3>
  <img src="personPict.jpg" width="50%"><br>
  person is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, <br>
  consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form <br>
  of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. <br>
  The defining features of personhood and consequently what makes a person count as a person <br>
  differ widely among cultures and contexts.
