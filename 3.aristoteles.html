<p>
<strong>Aristotle (/ˈærɪˌstɒtəl/;[3] Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, pronounced
[aristotélɛːs]; 384–322 BC)</strong> <br>was a philosopher during the Classical period in
Ancient Greece, <br>the founder of the Lyceum and the Peripatetic school of philosophy
and Aristotelian tradition. <br>Along with his teacher Plato, he is considered the
<u><a href="https://www.ancient.eu/socrates/" target="_blank" title="greek philosophy">"Father of Western Philosophy"</u></a>. <br>His writings cover many subjects – including physics,
biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, <br>aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric,
psychology, linguistics, economics, politics and government.</p>
<p>Aristotle provided a complex
synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him, <br>and it was above all from his teachings
that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, <br>as well as problems and methods of inquiry. <br></p>
<p>
As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge <br>
in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.
