<p><strong>Socrates (469/470-399 BCE)</strong>
  The character of Socrates as exhibited in Apology, Crito, Phaedo and Symposium concurs
  <br>with other sources to an extent to which it seems possible to rely on the Platonic Socrates,
  <br>as demonstrated in the dialogues, as a representation of the actual Socrates as he lived in history.

  <p style="margin-top:30px;"> At the same time, however, many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar"
    title="about scholars" target="_blank">scholars</a> believe that in some works, Plato, being a literary artist,
    <br>pushed his avowedly brightened-up version of "Socrates" far beyond anything the historical Socrates was
    likely to have done or said.
    Also, Xenophon, being an historian, is a more reliable witness to the historical Socrates.
    <br>It is a matter of much debate over which Socrates it is whom Plato is describing at any given
    point—the historical figure,
    <br>or Plato's fictionalization.
    As British philosopher Martin Cohen has put it, "Plato, the idealist, offers an idol,
    a master figure, for philosophy. A Saint, a prophet of 'the Sun-God',
    a teacher condemned for his teachings as a heretic.
